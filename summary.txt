On April 14, 2020, Obama endorsed his former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, for president in the 2020 election, stating that he has "all the qualities we need in a president right now."[486][487] In May 2020, Obama criticized President Trump for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, calling his response to the crisis "an absolute chaotic disaster", and stating that the consequences of the Trump presidency have been "our worst impulses unleashed, our proud reputation around the world badly diminished, and our democratic institutions threatened like never before."[488] Trump retaliated by accusing Obama of having committed "the biggest political crime in American history", although he refused to say what he was talking about, telling reporters: "You know what the crime is, the crime is very obvious to everybody."[489] Obama wrote a presidential memoir, in a $65 million deal with Penguin Random House.[490] The book, A Promised Land, was released on November 17, 2020.[491][492][493] In February 2021, Obama and musician Bruce Springsteen started a podcast called Renegades: Born in the USA where the two talk about "their backgrounds, music and their 'enduring love of America.'"[494][495] More recently, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with Netflix, in a venture with the his and Michelle's Higher Ground to develop comedy projects.[496]

Bush.[515]

According to Julian Zelizer's The Presidency of Barack Obama, under Obama's presidency, the "Democrats lost more than one thousand seats in state legislatures, governors' mansions, and Congress during his time in office." adding that Obama "turned out to be a very effective policymaker but not a tremendously successful party builder."[516]

During Obama's presidency, a record 3.2 million people were deported from the United States.[517] His record deportations earned Obama the nickname "Deporter in Chief".[518] In February 2020, Biden called the deportation of hundreds of thousands of people without criminal records under the Obama administration a "big mistake".[519]

Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60 percent approval rating.[520][521] A 2018 survey of historians by the American Political Science Association ranked Obama the 8th-greatest American President.[4] Obama gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the Brookings Institution that ranked him the 18th-greatest American President.[522]

Cultural and political image

Obama's family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement.[428] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is "black enough", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that "we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong."[429] Obama acknowledged his youthful image in an October 2007 campaign speech, saying: "I wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation."[430]

Obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator.[431] During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses.[432] In his speeches as president, Obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors,[433][434] but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of African-Americans than any president since the Nixon era.[435]


Presidential approval ratings
According to the Gallup Organization, Obama began his presidency with a 68 percent approval rating[436] before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41 percent in August 2010,[437] a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office.[438] He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011

military took part in air strikes to destroy the Libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone,[372] including the use of Tomahawk missiles, B-2 Spirits, and fighter jets.[373][374][375] Six days later, on March 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members, NATO took over leadership of the effort, dubbed Operation Unified Protector.[376] Some Representatives[377] questioned whether Obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.[378][379] Obama later expressed regret for playing a leading role in the destabilization of Libya, calling the certain situation there "a mess."[380] He has stated that the lack of preparation surrounding the days following the government's overthrow was the "worst mistake" of his presidency.[381]

Syrian Civil War

On August 18, 2011, several months after the start of the Syrian Civil War, Obama issued a written statement that said: "The time has come for President Assad to step aside."[382][383] This stance was reaffirmed in November 2015.[384] In 2012, Obama authorized multiple programs run by the CIA and the Pentagon to train anti-Assad rebels.[385] The Pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in October 2015.[386][387]

In the wake of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, formally blamed by the Obama administration on the Assad government, Obama chose not to enforce the "red line" he had pledged[388] and, rather than authorize the promised military action against Assad, went along with the Russia-brokered deal that led to Assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued.[389][390] In 2014, Obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at ISIL.[391]
